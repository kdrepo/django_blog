But it will tire you....*\n\nNo, it doesn't tire me.\n\n(*Mother reads*)\n\n>The body-mind\n\n>And there is too an obscure mind of the body, of the very cells, molecules, corpuscles. Haeckel, the German materialist, spoke somewhere of the will in the atom, and recent science, dealing with the incalculable individual variation in the activity of the electrons, comes near to perceiving that this is not a figure but the shadow thrown by a secret reality. This body-mind is a very tangible truth; owing to its obscurity and mechanical clinging to past movements and facile oblivion and rejection of the new, we find in it one of the chief obstacles to permeation by the supermind Force and the transformation of the functioning of the body. On the other hand, once effectively converted, it will be one of the most precious instruments for the stabilisation of the supramental Light and Force in material Nature.\n\n>([XXII.340](/sabcl/22/planes-and-parts-of-the-being-x#p15))\n\nIt corresponds exactly to my own experience.\n\nIt is this mind of the cells which seizes upon a mantra or a japa and eventually repeats it automatically, and with what persistence! That is to say, CONTINUALLY. That's what Sri Aurobindo means when he says it can be a help: it keeps at things indefinitely (*Mother clenches her fist in an unwavering gesture*).\n\nA few days ago, at the end of an activity or a situation which demanded an effort, almost a struggle, I heard (it's odd), I heard the cells repeat my mantra! It was like a choir in which each cell<span class='page-number' id='s-159' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'><a href='https://incarnateword.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/imagevolumes/agenda/04/159.jpg' class='lightbox'>[p.159]</a></span> was repeating the mantra, automatically.... \"Well, this is odd!\" I thought. And it was just after that, the next day and the day after, that someone showed me this letter.\n\nIt is astonishingly true.\n\nI heard it—I heard THE CELLS repeating the mantra. Automatically, in the difficulty (there was a difficulty), they were repeating the mantra. Like a choir, an immense choir in a church, it was very odd. As if there were lots of little voices, innumerable little voices repeating and repeating the same sound. It gave me the impression of a church choir, but with lots and lots and lots of choirboys—tiny little voices. Yet the sound was very clear, I was dumbfounded: very clear. The sound of the mantra.\n\n*But is this the mind the Tantrics use? For instance, when you speak of the \"deep blue light\" in the physical mind, is it the same cellular mind?*\n\nI don't think so.\n\n*Because it's also through japa, mantras, the awakening of the physical consciousness, that the Tantric power operates.*\n\nI think their power comes from a higher layer [higher than the cellular mind]. Because their action is very cerebral: its effect is always here (*gesture at the forehead and temples*), it takes you here (*same gesture*)—it's even painful!\n\nIt's cerebral.\n\n*But how does that power act in Matter? Because they do have a power over Matter.*\n\nBecause it's very material—the brain is material! It's just a little less mechanical than the cellular mind. But it Is material; it isn't the higher mind, certainly: it's a mind confined to the body (*same gesture to the temples*). But the mind I was speaking of, the body-mind, is EVERYWHERE, in every cell: every cell has it within it; whereas that power is specifically situated at the brain level. It's a very cerebral action, enveloping the forehead and the lower part of the face, not even down to the throat.\n\n---\n\nHow is your \"writing\" coming on? All right?<span class='page-number' id='s-160' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'><a href='https://incarnateword.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/imagevolumes/agenda/04/160.jpg' class='lightbox'>[p.160]</a></span>\n\n*Yes, I am no longer tired as I was before, but... It's a domain that seems so mechanical to me!*\n\nYet I put the Force in it.\n\nI put the Force in it, because I can SEE your yantram like this (*Mother closes her eyes and says aloud*): 6, 12, 30....\n\nI see it, it exists.\n\nIt has a reality now.\n\nAnd there's a rhythm—a very nice rhythm: 6, 12, 30, 48....\n\nCan you see when I say it?\n\nIt has become real, I can assure you.\n\n---\n\n*Shortly afterwards:*\n\nYesterday I saw a seven-month-old baby... who is a sage.\n\nHe looks at you with his soul. When I looked at him, his eyes lit up.\n\nDoesn't cry, doesn't speak, but he made a sort of noise—he stretched out his arms to me and seemed to say, \"Aaah!\" Then I took him in my arms, and he laid his head there, on my heart—he didn't close his eyes, he became ecstatic.\n\nExtraordinary! I have never seen that before, it's the first time ever.\n\nThen Champaklal (who had brought the baby) didn't want him to go without having touched my feet (I thought it was going to cause a disaster): Champaklal put him on the floor, bent his head forward—as soon as the baby saw my feet, he caught them with his two hands, one hand on each foot!\n\nSeven months old!\n\nAnd not a noise: only that \"Aaah!\"\n\nHe had never seen Champaklal before; Champaklal took him, he didn't say anything, didn't protest: he was upright, sitting upright on Champaklal's arm.\n\nHis eyes! Eyes that look within already. When I looked into his eyes, there was an immediate response—a response I have rarely seen in people's eyes here.\n\nHe didn't ask for anything, he was happy. And all of a sudden, that \"Aaah!\" I took him in my arms—he immediately put his head here, on my heart. Didn't move any more.\n\nI don't know who it is.<span class='page-number' id='s-161' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'><a href='https://incarnateword.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/imagevolumes/agenda/04/161.jpg' class='lightbox'>[p.161]</a></span>\n\nI thought I would know afterwards, but I don't. I don't know. I have only a kind of knowledge in the background that it's not a complete person, it's an emanation of someone who has come and established himself there consciously. But someone... I wouldn't be surprised if I were told it's Sri Aurobindo. As if Sri Aurobindo had made an emanation and put it there (I don't say so, I don't know). But it's not just anyone or anything.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Mother will see the child again four years later and will then discover in him an emanation of an ancient Pharaoh (See *Agenda*, [May 10, 1967](/agenda/08/may-10-1967)).\n\nEither it's one of the unincarnate beings, or else it's Sri Aurobindo, who has allowed himself that indulgence!\n\nHe is very small, very small, but not with a big head and a small body: well-proportioned. Very small, no bigger than this. Seven months old.\n\nBut well-formed: lovely hands, lovely arms, lovely feet. Very well-formed.\n\nIt's a new thing, I have never seen such a baby, never.\n\nHe came to earth in America (that's already a sign), but his parents are Indians. Entirely conceived and formed, all nine months, in America. And born in America. He spent the first four or five months of his life in America.\n\nHis mother, before marrying, told me, \"I will have a child only when I want it and, I hope, in the way I want it.\" It was no accident.\n\nAh, we'd better get to work!
